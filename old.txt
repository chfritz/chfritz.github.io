My passion is to lead R&D teams that take state-of-the-art research results and apply them to hard real-world problems with concrete business value. My background includes both AI research and technology management, and I like to apply this background to think strategically about the big picture of how AI can solve real-world problems with a viable business model.

I am experienced leading teams of both researchers and software engineers but am hands-on and have development experience along the full stack. During my tenure at PARC I have proposed several projects and obtained funding for them from various sources (government, Xerox, commercial, and internal). In leading these projects I often focus on connecting the big picture with the devilish detail while still contributing directly. My academic area of expertise is logic-based knowledge representation for dynamical systems with specific application to AI planning and execution monitoring. I chose this as my thesis topic after my previous, frustrating experience trying to make real robots score goals in robotic soccer.

I earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Knowledge Representation group at the University of Toronto, Canada, and his M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen, Germany, where I was part of the Allemaniacs RobCup team which later won the RoboCup@home world-cup several times in a row. For my thesis I received the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) Doctoral Consortium Best Paper Award (2007) and the ICAPS Best Dissertation Runner-Up award (2010).
