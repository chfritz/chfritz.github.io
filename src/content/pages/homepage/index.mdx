I am currently founder & CEO at [Transitive Robotics](https://transitiverobotics.com/). I created the open-source Transitive framework out of the belief that the robotics industry is lacking a shared, open platform for the development of full-stack robotic software. As a result, robotics companies lose time creating their own cloud middle-ware for robotics and reimplementing dozens of common full-stack components when this time could be better spent on their specific product. I worked for six different robotics startups and have seen this time and time again. Previously, I was VP of Software at Savioke, maker of the Relay delivery robot for hotels and hospitals, where I helped scale the fleet from 5 to over 100 robots operating on three continents. I earned my PhD in computer science (artifical intelligence) from the University of Toronto. You can find my publications and patents below.
