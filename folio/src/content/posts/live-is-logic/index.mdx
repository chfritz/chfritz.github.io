What is 453,634,563 + 2,688,222? You can calculate it in your head or use a calculator but the result is the same: 456,322,785. Since when is that the case? Did the result of this addition only start to exist after you calculated it? Of course not! Addition, like all mathematical operations, is completely time-less. Nor did anyone first have to _invent_ 456,322,785 as the sum of 453,634,563 and 2,688,222, and even if no person or other intelligent being ever thought about adding these two numbers, the result already existed before we even asked the question.

In this article I will try to convince you that it is the same with life itself. In particular, one does not need to bother with the idea of a simulation that we live in. The mere _idea_ or concept itself of our universe and the life resulting from it is already sufficient for it to exist. Just like the result of 453,634,563 + 2,688,222 existed before you calculated it.

## Refuting Simulation: Occam's Razor

Imagine someone building a simulation. This could be John Conway inventing the rules of his famous Game of Life, or something more widely known like Minecraft or, well, Sims. Every simulation is defined, roughly, by an initial state and a "transition function", which is a function that, for each possible state of the world, determines the next state or the next set of possible states if the simulation is non-deterministic. These two things together define the entire simulation. In practice, it is helpful to break these two concepts down further. For example the state of the world can be broken down into things that can change, such as the age of a character, and those that don't, e.g., the terrain or landscape. The transition function is usually where all the complication resides and it is often structured in terms of things like rules of survival, resources, and the physics of the simulated world (what is possible and what isn't).

- (Level 1) when does that "life" start to exist?
  - only once it is implemented in a computer and simulated?
    - which state or evolution of that life exists at that point? only the current (sequence of) state(s) that have been simulated so far?
  - doesn't it already exist when the rules are conceived?
    - all possible logical consequences are already fully determined at that point

- (Level 2) once we convince ourselves of the latter, the simulated life exists once conceived, we can go a step further and ask: did it need to be conceived first in order to exist?
  - isn't the mere _possibility_ of John Conway conceiving the rules sufficient for them to exist?

  - it doesn't require a thinker or computer or simulation executor of any kind for the system/life being executed to exist

- The big benefit of this thesis, of course, is that the simulation thesis really just kicks the bucket "up the chain". It's not a definitive answer. It immediately raises the question: in what world does that simulation run, and how did _that_ world come to be?
  - Our thesis here does not suffer from this flaw, because logic and its consequences do not require materialization. They exist, "hold true", even if never represented in anything that can be observed.

## Logic and Existence

- "anything that can be hypothesized and is logically sound, exists"
- only sound theories "survive" (contradictory theories "never existed")
- We "exist" because the laws of physics are sound and hence all possible consequences (such as biology), *do* exist, and the formation of Earth, evolution, and human life are some of those consequences.

### Math

- It is important to recognize that math was not invented by humans, it was _discovered_. 1 + 1 = 2 even if you use different symbols. For instance, if you and your friend find two apples, then each of you can have one for themselves. For this outcome it is irrelevant whether you and your friend know what numbers are, or what addition and division is. Mathematical properties of numbers and operations hold in nature no matter how we call them, and they held true long before humans discovered them. They are time-less.
- Because it is timeless, math also existed before the Big Bang.

### The Logic of Life

- math > physics > biology + chemistry ...

## What then is existence?

The aspect most difficult to comprehend about this theory is the notion of existence itself. Simulations, such as computer simulations, are satisfying because some physical (electronic) representation _exists_ (in some world) that can be observed (in that same world).

But logical consequences also exist, as we have seen in the addition example, independent of their representation. So what then is existence?

Existence = logical consequence. 456,322,785 exists, because 453,634,563 and 2,688,222 exist, the notion of addition exists, *and*, importantly, mathematical logic is sound. The astute reader might ask, how do we know that 453,634,563 and 2,688,222 exist? The answer is, of course, that they, too can be derived from a basic axiomatization (set of rules) of numbers and addition, which itself is sound.

### Relativity of Existence

Much like Einstein's relativity theory relied on the notion of an inside and and outside system, so does this thesis of life-as-logic benefit from such a distinction. Ironically, but perhaps not coincidentally, the distinct notion of time between inside and outside system is of particular interest. For passengers and clocks (theoretically) traveling at half of light speed in a spaceship, time progresses more slowly then to the outside world. In our theory, time is a concept that is experienced in its linear, always-moving-forward form only in the inside system. The outside system itself, which is best to be thought of as a set of equations that govern the inside system, is completely time-less, just like addition in math is -- at least in terms of the notion of time we experience on the inside. Clearly, if it so happens that the logic we live in is actually simulated/computed/materialized in the outside world, then the outside world could have it's own notion of time, thereby establishing the certain relativity. But as we argued above, this is not required to explain the existence of our universe, i.e., the inside system.

## Probabilities

- "true randomness" vs. "stochastic outcomes"
  - "does god roll dice?"

DRAFT

## Ramifications

- despite the beautiful simplicity of this thesis of life, it's also surprisingly useless
- parallel universes do exist
  - and no, you absolutely cannot "travel" between them, so it doesn't matter
- time does not exist outside of "life"
  - but inside it does, so still a rather useless insight
- in fact, the thesis itself primarily outlines the prison we live in rather than setting us free
  - there is no way to escape logic!

- Meaning of life: If this thesis suggests anything about the meaning or purpose of life then only that we way want to try to figure out all the rules, i.e., do science.
  - however, it seems very unlikely that even if we figure out all the rules will we be able to "compute" all consequence of life. That's because we are stuck inside the box defined by those rules.
  - We can certainly build simulations of a partial understanding of life (e.g., cell biology), and that will (and already does) allow us to better understand our lives.
  - But because one of the primary rules in the box we live in is that time moves at a certain speed and is linear, we cannot expect to ever compute all of it.


## Provability

- this thesis cannot be proven, but it cannot be refuted either
  - any other explanation needs to, at least, include this explanation of logic controlling all of "life". As such, Occam's razor suggests this thesis to be more likely than any other, in particular the simulation thesis.
- hence, the only aspect that is worth trying to prove is its minimality: Can there be any other theory of life/the universe that makes fewer assumptions and still explains all of it?
- logically, the only way to disprove it is to either show that it isn't minimal or that it doesn't explain everything
