What is 453,634,563 + 2,688,222? You can calculate it in your head or use a calculator but the result is the same: 456,322,785. Since when is that the case? Did the result of this addition only exist when you calculated it? Of course not! Addition, like all mathematical operations, is completely time-less. Nor did anyone first have to _invent_ 456,322,785 as the sum of 453,634,563 and 2,688,222, and even if no person or other intelligent being ever thought about adding these two numbers, the result already existed before we even asked the question.

In this article I will try to convince you that that is the same for life itself. In particular, one does not need to bother with the idea of a simulation that we live in. The mere _idea_ or concept of life itself is already sufficient for it to exist. Just like 453,634,563 + 2,688,222 = 456,322,785 existed before you calculated it.

## Logic and Existence

- "anything that can be hypothesized and is logically sound, exists"
- only sound theories "survive" (contradictory theories "never existed")

### Math

- It is important to recognize that math was not invented by humans, it was _discovered_. 1 + 1 = 2 even if you use different symbols. For instance, if you and your friend find two apples, then each of you can have one for themselves. For this outcome it is irrelevant whether you and your friend know what numbers are, or what addition and division is. Mathematical properties of numbers and operations hold in nature no matter how we call them, and they held true long before humans discovered them. They are time-less.


## Refuting Simulation: Occam's razor

- Imagine someone wanting to build a life simulation
  - e.g., John Conway's game of life
  - rules of survival, reproduction, resources, "physics" (what is possible and what isn't), etc.
- (Level 1) when does that "life" start to exist?
  - only once it is implemented in a computer and simulated?
    - which state or evolution of that life exists at that point? only the current (sequence of) state(s) that have been simulated so far?
  - doesn't it already exist when the rules are conceived?
    - all possible logical consequences are already fully determined at that point

- (Level 2) once we convince ourselves of the latter, the simulated life exists once conceived, we can go a step further and ask: did it need to be conceived first in order to exist?
  - isn't the mere _possibility_ of John Conway conceiving the rules sufficient for them to exist?

- it doesn't require a thinker or computer or simulation executor of any kind for the system/life being executed to exist

- The big benefit of this thesis, of course, is that the simulation thesis really just kicks the bucket "up the chain". It's not a definitive answer. It immediately raises the question: in what world does that simulation run, and how did _that_ world come to be?
  - Our thesis here does not suffer from this flaw, because logic and its consequences do not require materialization. They exist, "hold true", even if never represented in anything that can be observed.


## What then is existence?

The most aspect to comprehend about this theory is the notion of existence itself. Simulations, such as computer simulations, are satisfying because some physical (electronic) representation _exists_ (in some world) that can be observed (in that same world).

But logical consequences also exist, as we have seen in the addition example, independent of their representation. So what then is existence?

Existence = logical consequence. 456,322,785 exists, because 453,634,563 and 2,688,222 exist, the notion of addition exists, *and*, importantly, mathematical logic is sound. The astute reader might ask, how do we know that 453,634,563 and 2,688,222 exist? The answer is, of course, that they, too can be derived from a basic axiomatization (set of rules) of numbers and addition, which itself is sound.


## Probabilities

- "true randomness" vs. "stochastic outcomes"
  - "does god roll dice?"

## The Logic of Life

- math > physics > biology + chemistry ...

DRAFT

## Ramifications

- despite the beautiful simplicity of this thesis of life, it's also surprisingly useless
- parallel universes do exist
  - and no, you absolutely cannot "travel" between them, so it doesn't matter
- time does not exist outside of "life"
  - but inside it does, so still a rather useless insight
- in fact, the thesis itself outlines the prison we live in rather than setting is free
  - there is no way to escape logic!

- Meaning of life: If this thesis suggests anything about the meaning or purpose of life then only that we way want to try to figure out all the rules, i.e., do science.
  - however, it seems very unlikely that even if we figure out all the rules will we be able to "compute" all consequence of life. That's because we are stuck inside the box defined by those rules.
  - We can certainly build simulations of a partial understanding of life (e.g., cell biology), and that will (and already does) allow us to better understand our lives.
  - But because one of the primary rules in the box we live in is that time moves at a certain speed and is linear, we cannot expect to ever compute all of it.


## Provability

- this thesis cannot be proven, but it cannot be refuted either
  - any other explanation needs to, at least, include this explanation of logic controlling all of "life". As such, Occam's razor suggests this thesis to be more likely than any other, in particular the simulation thesis.
